Implement a new feature end-to-end. Ask for:
1. Feature description
2. Whether it needs auth
3. What data it needs (new models? existing?)
Then coordinate the team:
- Team Lead: design API contract + shared types
- Backend Developer: implement API + services + migrations
- Frontend Developer: build pages + components
- QA Engineer: write tests at every layer
Present implementation plan before starting.
