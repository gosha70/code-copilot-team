Reusable, opinionated configuration for AI-assisted coding with multi-agent team delegation. Ships with templates for ML/AI, Enterprise Java, and Web projects.

Built for **Claude Code** as the reference implementation, with portable conventions for Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, and local LLMs.

> 📖 **Deep dive:** [Stop Fighting AI Agents and Build a Reusable Multi-Agent Dev Environment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-fighting-ai-agents-build-reusable-multi-agent-dev-george-ivan-mxwbe) — the full story behind this project, lessons learned from 13+ real build sessions, and why every rule exists.

---

## Why This Exists

Every rule in this repo is failure-driven — it exists because we hit the specific failure it prevents, often more than once. After analyzing 13 sessions of a real project build, we identified six recurring patterns: dependency breaks, agents ignoring conventions, context window exhaustion, schema drift during parallel builds, agents not asking clarifying questions, and commit granularity issues. This setup prevents all of them.

## Framework Compliance

Evaluated against the two leading AI coding agent frameworks (February 2026):

## Further Reading

- [Spec-Driven Development vs Code Copilot Team](docs/sdd-vs-code-copilot-team.md) — Side-by-side comparison with GitHub's Spec Kit. TL;DR: SDD defines *what* to build; Code Copilot Team defines *how to behave* while building it. They're complementary, not competing.


## Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

Code Copilot Team includes a built-in Spec-Driven Development layer that prevents "vibe coding" — the tendency of AI agents to start writing code before requirements are clear. SDD ensures every feature goes through a structured specification process, with the rigor scaled to match the risk.

### How It Works

Every task is classified into one of three **spec modes** based on risk:

| spec_mode | When | What's Required |
|---|---|---|
| **full** | Security, schema changes, integration, features touching >2 files | `plan.md` + `spec.md` + `tasks.md` |
| **lightweight** | Features touching 1–2 files, non-critical changes | `plan.md` + `spec.md` |
| **none** | Bug fixes (non-security), docs, trivial changes | `plan.md` only |

The Plan agent writes `plan.md` with a YAML frontmatter block that declares `spec_mode`, `feature_id`, `risk_category`, and `justification`. The Build agent reads this frontmatter and gates itself accordingly — it won't proceed on a `full` task without a complete `spec.md`, and it won't proceed on any task that has unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers.

### The Four Artifacts

SDD uses exactly four artifact types (no checklists, no extra process):

| Artifact | Purpose | When Created |
|---|---|---|
| `plan.md` | Implementation plan with frontmatter gating | Always (all modes) |
| `spec.md` | Requirements, user scenarios, constraints | `full` and `lightweight` only |
| `tasks.md` | Task breakdown with story and priority markers | `full` only |
| `lessons-learned.md` | Cross-project learnings for future sessions | End of project |

Templates for all four live in `shared/templates/sdd/` and are available across all adapters.

### Three-Layer Gating

SDD enforcement operates at three levels:

1. **Agent-level** — The Build agent reads `plan.md` frontmatter and conditionally requires `spec.md` and resolves `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers before proceeding.
2. **CI validation** — `scripts/validate-spec.sh` runs on every PR touching `specs/`. It validates frontmatter fields, checks for required files per spec_mode, and enforces justification for `spec_mode: none`.
3. **Hooks** — Existing hooks remain untouched; SDD gating is additive, not intrusive.

### Spec Artifacts Location

All SDD artifacts live in the versioned `specs/` directory, organized by feature:

```
specs/
└── <feature-id>/
    ├── plan.md              ← Always present
    ├── spec.md              ← full / lightweight
    ├── tasks.md             ← full only
    ├── lessons-learned.md   ← End of project
    └── collaboration/       ← Peer review artifacts (dual mode)
        ├── plan-consult.md  ← Peer review of plan phase
        └── build-review.md  ← Peer review of build phase
```

### Risk Classification

The `spec-workflow.md` rule defines risk categories that map directly to spec_mode:

| Risk Category | spec_mode | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `security` | full | Auth changes, secrets handling, permission logic |
| `schema` | full | Database migrations, API contract changes |
| `integration` | full | Third-party integrations, cross-service changes |
| `feature` | full or lightweight | New features (full if >2 files, lightweight if 1–2) |
| `bug` | none | Non-security bug fixes |
| `docs` | none | Documentation-only changes |

### Adapter Support

SDD rules propagate through the same `shared/ → generate.sh → adapters/` pipeline as all other rules. Claude Code gets enforced gating via agent manifests. Other adapters receive advisory content appropriate to their capabilities:

| Adapter | SDD Support Level |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | **Enforced** — agents gate on frontmatter |
| GitHub Copilot | Full instructions (advisory) |
| Cursor, Windsurf | Always-on rules only (advisory) |
| Aider | Conventions only (advisory) |

### Getting Started with SDD

1. Start a Plan session — describe your feature to the Plan agent.
2. The Plan agent classifies risk, sets `spec_mode`, and writes the appropriate artifacts to `specs/<feature-id>/`.
3. Switch to Build — the Build agent reads the frontmatter and gates itself.
4. CI validates on PR — `validate-spec.sh` catches any missing artifacts or incomplete specs.

No additional setup required — SDD is active by default after installation.

## Shape-Up (Product Bets)

SDD answers *"how do we know we built the right thing?"* — Shape-Up answers *"what do we build next, and how big should it be?"* The two are complementary: a pitch describes the *bet*, SDD's plan/spec/tasks describe the *implementation* underneath one or more scopes of that pitch.

Code Copilot Team ships a local-first Shape-Up implementation: pitches and hill charts as plain files under `specs/pitches/<id>/`, four agents (`pitch-shaper`, `scope-executor`, `cycle-retro`, `cooldown-report`), five slash commands (`/shape`, `/bet`, `/cycle-start`, `/hill`, `/cooldown`), and `validate-pitch.sh` enforcing frontmatter (appetite ∈ `{2w, 4w, 6w}`, bet_status lifecycle, cycle/circuit-breaker conditional rules) on every PR.

Use Shape-Up for product-shaped work — greenfield, ambiguous problem space, multiple possible solutions, time-boxed bets. Use SDD alone for feature-shaped work where the requirement is clear.

## Peer Review (Multi-Copilot)

Code Copilot Team supports **dual-copilot peer review** — a second AI provider automatically reviews your work at phase completion. This catches blind spots that a single provider misses, using the same structured collaboration protocol regardless of which providers are involved.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Code Copilot Team** — run `setup.sh --claude-code` (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)). This installs all peer review components:
   - `peer-review-runner.sh` and `providers-health.sh` to `~/.local/bin/`
   - `peer-review-on-stop.sh` hook to `~/.claude/hooks/`
   - `/phase-complete` command to `~/.claude/commands/`
   - Provider profile seed to `~/.code-copilot-team/providers.toml`

2. **Install the peer provider CLI** — the peer provider must be available on your machine. For example, to use OpenAI Codex as a peer reviewer, install the Codex CLI first.

3. **Verify provider availability:**
   ```bash
   providers-health.sh
   ```

### Setup — New Projects

```bash
# 1. Init project from template
claude-code init ml-rag ~/projects/my-app

# 2. Start session with peer review
claude-code --peer-review codex ~/projects/my-app
```

### Setup — Existing Projects

No project-level changes required. Peer review is driven entirely by session flags and global hooks:

```bash
# Just add --peer-review to your usual launch command
claude-code --peer-review codex ~/projects/existing-app

# Or use the default peer from your provider profile
cd ~/projects/existing-app && claude-code --peer-review
```

### How It Works

1. **Start a session with peer review enabled:**
   ```bash
   claude-code --peer-review codex ~/projects/my-app   # explicit peer provider
   claude-code --peer-review ~/projects/my-app          # default peer from profile
   claude-code --peer-review-off ~/projects/my-app      # disable for this session
   claude-code --peer-review-scope code ~/projects/my-app  # scope: code|design|both
   ```

2. **Work normally** through the Plan → Build phases. Claude detects `CCT_PEER_REVIEW_ENABLED=true` in the environment and sets `collaboration_mode: dual` in the SDD plan.

3. **Run `/review-submit`** after completing work — the Build agent runs this to start the review loop. The runner spawns a reviewer LLM in a read-only sandbox, captures structured findings, and returns a verdict. On FAIL, the agent addresses findings and resubmits. On PASS, proceed to `/phase-complete`.

4. **Run `/phase-complete`** when review passes — validates that `loop-summary.json` exists, runs the post-phase checklist, and presents the commit for approval.

5. **Review the artifact** — the collaboration artifact (`build-review.md` or `plan-consult.md`) is written to `specs/<feature-id>/collaboration/` with structured findings and a verdict.

### Provider Profile

Peer providers are configured in `~/.code-copilot-team/providers.toml` (seeded by setup):

```toml
[defaults]
peer_for.claude = "codex"
peer_for.codex = "claude"

[providers.codex]
type = "cli"
command = "codex --quiet --prompt-file {review_request}"
timeout_sec = 300
healthcheck = "codex --version"

[providers.ollama]
type = "ollama"
command = "ollama run {model} < {review_request}"
model = "llama3"
timeout_sec = 600
healthcheck = "ollama list"
```

Every provider currently requires a `command` template with `{review_request}` and `{model}` placeholders. The `type` field (`cli`, `openai-compatible`, `ollama`, `custom`) declares the provider topology and will enable type-aware dispatch and dedicated adapter scripts in a future update. See `shared/templates/provider-profile-template.toml` for all type-specific fields and commented-out examples.

### Safety Model

- **Fail-closed** — enforced at two levels: (1) `/phase-complete` requires `loop-summary.json` with PASS or bypass before proceeding, (2) the stop hook blocks session end if review was started but not completed (exit 2). If review was never started, the hook warns but does not block.
- **Circuit breakers** — max rounds (default 5), wall-clock timeout (15 min), stale findings, provider unavailability. All escalate to human via `/review-decide`.
- **Read-only sandbox** — reviewer runs in a snapshot copy; real working tree is never modified by the reviewer.
- **Escape hatch** — set `CCT_PEER_BYPASS=true` to skip validation. CI rejects bypass artifacts.
- **Identity tracking** — collaboration artifacts include `peer_profile` (provider name) and `runner_fingerprint` (SHA-256 of provider config) for auditability.

### Collaboration Modes

| Mode | When | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **single** (default) | No `--peer-review` flag | Standard single-provider workflow, no peer review |
| **dual** | `--peer-review [provider]` | Peer reviews at `/phase-complete`, artifacts written to `specs/` |

## LLM Wiki Maintainer

`code-copilot-team` ships a Karpathy-pattern LLM Wiki maintainer that
turns `knowledge/raw/` into a curated, cited, agent-readable markdown
layer under `knowledge/wiki/`. Four operations, one CLI:

```bash
./scripts/wiki ingest <source>          # multi-page write plan against existing wiki state
./scripts/wiki promote <proposal-dir>   # atomic apply (only writer to the canonical wiki content tree, excluding .audit/)
./scripts/wiki query "<question>"       # index-first synthesis with citations
./scripts/wiki query --file-back "..."  # round-trip the answer back into a patch-set
./scripts/wiki lint                     # structural lint (frontmatter, links, slugs)
./scripts/wiki lint --health [--strict] # knowledge-health (contradictions, stale claims, weak orphans, missing cross-links)
```

**Human approval is always gating, and the source-control boundary
is explicit: the wiki is source-controlled, the proposal workspace
is not.** `wiki ingest` writes draft proposals to a local-only
`doc_internal/proposals/` directory (gitignored — proposals are
working drafts, not canonical state). `wiki promote` is the only
operation that writes to the canonical `knowledge/wiki/` content tree;
`wiki ingest` has one additional tracked write: appending to the
append-only `knowledge/wiki/.audit/ingest-log.md` audit ledger. The
audit trail under `knowledge/wiki/.audit/` records every `wiki ingest`
decision (timestamp, source SHA, backend, disposition, reason) in
`ingest-log.md`, and every accepted proposal's original LLM draft in
`knowledge/wiki/.audit/proposals/<date>-<slug>/` (applied atomically
by `wiki promote`). A pending follow-up —
[gosha70/code-copilot-team#37](https://github.com/gosha70/code-copilot-team/issues/37)
— will add `wiki audit-flush` for reject-only workflows. Promotion
history is traceable via git on `knowledge/wiki/` plus
`knowledge/wiki/log.md`.

The CLI auto-detects an installed copilot backend in the order
`claude → codex → cursor`. Override with `--backend <name>` or
`WIKI_INGEST_BACKEND=<name>`. Use `--backend test` for the
deterministic stub backend (no LLM call; this is what CI uses).

For the v1 single-source flow, the legacy invocation
`./scripts/wiki-ingest <source>` is preserved as a backwards-compat
alias.

## What You Get

![Configuration Layers](docs/images/configuration-layers.png)

- **Layered rules** — 4 global rules (`~/.claude/rules/`) auto-load every session; 15 on-demand skills (`~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) loaded by phase agents when needed.
- **Phase agents** (`~/.claude/agents/`) — 4 phase agents (research, plan, build, review) plus 5 utility agents (code-simplifier, doc-writer, phase-recap, security-review, verify-app).
- **Hooks** (`~/.claude/hooks/`) — 11 lifecycle scripts: test verification, type checking, auto-format, file protection, git safety guards, context re-injection, peer review trigger, desktop notifications, plus 3 self-guarding MemKernel hooks (session recall, pre-compact checkpoint, post-compact recovery) that activate only when MemKernel is installed.
- **11 project templates** — pre-configured `CLAUDE.md` files with stack-specific conventions, slash commands, and agent team roles for each project archetype.
- **Four-phase workflow** — Research → Plan → Build → Review. Plus **Ralph Loop** for single-agent autonomous iteration.
![Three - Phase Agent Workflow](docs/images/three-phase-workflow.png)
- **Adaptive launcher** (`claude-code`) — uses `cmux` on macOS, `tmux` elsewhere, with git context display, `--peer-review` flags, and `sync` for keeping projects aligned with template updates.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/gosha70/code-copilot-team.git
cd code-copilot-team

# 2. Install for your tool(s)
./scripts/setup.sh --claude-code                    # Claude Code → ~/.claude/
./scripts/setup.sh --codex                          # OpenAI Codex → ~/.codex/
./scripts/setup.sh --cursor ~/my-project            # Cursor → project/.cursor/
./scripts/setup.sh --github-copilot ~/my-project    # GH Copilot → project/.github/
./scripts/setup.sh --windsurf ~/my-project          # Windsurf → project/.windsurf/
./scripts/setup.sh --aider ~/my-project             # Aider → project/CONVENTIONS.md

# Or install everything at once
./scripts/setup.sh --all ~/my-project

# Re-sync after pulling repo updates
git pull && ./scripts/setup.sh --sync --claude-code
```

The legacy `./claude_code/claude-setup.sh` path still works — it delegates to the adapter.

After `git pull`, run `--sync` to regenerate configs and re-install.

### Alternative: Install as a Claude Code Plugin

For Claude Code users who prefer the plugin system over `setup.sh`:

```bash
# Add the CCT marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add gosha70/code-copilot-team

# Install the hooks plugin
/plugin install code-copilot-team@code-copilot-team
```

This installs the same hooks (file protection, auto-format, type verification, context re-injection, git safety, notifications) as `setup.sh`, but managed through Claude Code's plugin system. Update installed plugins with `/plugin marketplace update`. The plugin does not include peer-review or memkernel hooks — those are CCT-pipeline-specific and remain in the `setup.sh` path.

Both install paths coexist. Use `setup.sh` for the full install (skills, agents, templates, hooks, peer review) or the plugin for hooks only.

### Recommended: Install LSP Plugins (Claude Code)

For continuous type-error feedback during edits, install the appropriate code-intelligence plugin. Each requires its language-server binary on `$PATH`:

```bash
# Install the language server first, then the plugin:
pip install pyright && /plugin install pyright-lsp@claude-plugins-official           # Python
npm i -g typescript-language-server typescript && /plugin install typescript-lsp@claude-plugins-official  # TypeScript
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest && /plugin install gopls-lsp@claude-plugins-official  # Go
```

These provide native LSP diagnostics and are preferred over the bundled `verify-after-edit.sh` hook. The hook remains as a fallback for languages without an LSP plugin. See the [official plugin catalog](https://claude.com/plugins) for all available languages.

## Start a New Project

```bash
# Initialize from a template
claude-code init ml-rag ~/projects/my-rag-app

# Start a Claude session in the project
claude-code ~/projects/my-rag-app
```

## Start in an Existing Project

```bash
# Just point the launcher at it — global rules load automatically
claude-code ~/projects/existing-api
```

## Sync a Project to Latest Template

After pulling repo updates, sync your project's commands and `.claude/` files against the latest template:

```bash
# 1. Update global config + templates from repo
git pull && ./scripts/setup.sh --sync --claude-code

# 2. Preview what would change (safe — no files modified)
claude-code sync ~/projects/my-rag-app --dry-run

# 3. Apply the sync
claude-code sync ~/projects/my-rag-app
```

Sync updates commands and `.claude/` contents (e.g. `remediation.json`) but never overwrites your `CLAUDE.md` — it shows a diff for manual review instead. Projects initialized with `claude-code init` have a `.claude/template.json` that tracks the template; older projects are matched by their `CLAUDE.md` heading.

## Available Templates

![Agent Team Delegation](docs/images/agent-team-roles.png)

|---|---|---|
| `ml-rag` | Python · FAISS/Chroma · Neo4j/NetworkX | Team Lead, RAG Engineer, KG Engineer, Data Analyst, QA |
| `ml-langchain` | Python · LangChain/LangGraph/LangSmith | Team Lead, Agent Developer, Integration Engineer, QA & Eval |

| `domain-pack` | Versioned content (TBX/JSON-LD/CSV) · Maven Central + PyPI dual publish | Team Lead, Content Curator, JVM Wrapper Eng, Python Wrapper Eng, Release & CI |

### Bundled CI Workflows

Each template ships a `.github/workflows/` file so CI is wired up the moment the consumer adds their toolchain manifest.

| Stack | Workflow file | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| `ml-app`, `ml-rag`, `ml-langchain`, `ml-n8n`, `ml-utils` | `python.yml` | ruff · mypy · pytest --cov · matrix: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 |
| `java-enterprise`, `java-tooling` | `gradle.yml` | `./gradlew build check test` · matrix: JDK 17, 21 · optional `publish-staging` on tags |
| `web-static`, `web-dynamic` | `node.yml` | lint · typecheck · test · matrix: Node 20, 22 · auto-detects npm/yarn/pnpm |
| `domain-pack` | `pack-content.yml` + `pack-publish.yml` | manifest + content schema validation on PR · coordinated Maven Central + PyPI publish on tag |
| `gradle-plugin` | `gradle-plugin.yml` | unit tests · TestKit functional matrix (Gradle 8.5/8.10/current) · sample-consumer smoke · Plugin Portal publish on tag |

**Auto-skip on empty project.** Each workflow's job is gated on a toolchain marker (`pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` / `setup.cfg` for Python, `package.json` for Node, `gradlew` for Gradle — the wrapper, since build steps invoke `./gradlew`). A freshly bootstrapped project with no marker yet gets a green skip rather than a red failure. The job activates as soon as the consumer adds the marker file. Gradle projects that have build scripts but no wrapper get a notice nudging them to run `gradle wrapper`.

**Matrix override via `workflow_dispatch`.** Every workflow accepts a manual trigger with an optional version input (e.g. `python-version: "3.12"` or `node-version: "20"`). Leave it blank to run the full matrix; set it to a specific version to run that one only.

**Dual-branch trigger.** All workflows fire on push to `master` or `main` — whichever convention a project uses.

**Bootstrap path.** `claude-code init <type>` copies `.github/workflows/` into the new project automatically. `claude-code sync` keeps the workflow file up to date alongside `remediation.json` and commands.

./.claude/commands/*.md            ← Project slash commands
./CLAUDE.local.md                  ← Personal overrides (gitignored)
```

Project-level rules override global rules. More specific always wins.

## Four-Phase Workflow

| Phase | Model | Effort | Delegation | What Happens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Research** | Opus (highest) | High | None | Explore codebase, summarize findings, identify constraints |
| **Plan** | Opus (highest) | High | None | Design approach, get user approval |
| **Build** | Sonnet (fast) | Medium | Yes | Team Lead delegates to specialist sub-agents |
| **Build (loop)** | Sonnet (fast) | Medium | None | Ralph Loop: single agent iterates through stories autonomously |
| **Review** | Opus (highest) | High | None | Holistic review, run tests, verify consistency |

Each phase has a dedicated agent (`~/.claude/agents/`) that loads the relevant rules from the rules library. Planning and research must stay in one mind — sub-agents only see fragments and can't reason about the whole system. Delegation only happens during Build. For smaller features, **Ralph Loop** provides a single-agent alternative: read PRD → implement next failing story → test → commit → repeat.

## Supported Tools

All tools share the same rules from `shared/skills/`. Each adapter formats them for the target tool.

| Tool | Adapter Output | Install Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | agents, hooks, commands, settings | `~/.claude/` (global) |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `AGENTS.md` + 5 skills | `~/.codex/` (global) |
| **Cursor** | `.mdc` files with frontmatter | `project/.cursor/rules/` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `copilot-instructions.md` + per-rule instructions | `project/.github/` |
| **Windsurf** | `rules.md` | `project/.windsurf/rules/` |
| **Aider** | `CONVENTIONS.md` | `project/` |
