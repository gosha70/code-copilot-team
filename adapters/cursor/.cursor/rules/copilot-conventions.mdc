# Cross-Copilot Conventions

Shared rules that apply whether using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or local LLMs.
These conventions ensure consistent behaviour regardless of which AI tool is driving.

## Core Contract

1. Read before write — understand existing code and patterns first.
2. Minimal changes — only modify what was requested.
3. Show your work — explain changes, provide diffs.
4. Test everything — run linters and tests after code changes.
5. Ask when uncertain — do not guess at ambiguous requirements.

## Single Source of Truth

- The repository is the only authoritative source for conventions and decisions.
- Do not rely on external docs (Confluence, Notion, Google Docs), chat history, or assumed knowledge.
- If information is needed but not in the repo, ask the user — then capture the answer in `doc_internal/` before proceeding.

## Git Discipline

- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise summary, optional body explaining "why".
- One logical change per commit — do not mix refactors with features.
- Branch naming: feature/, fix/, chore/, docs/ prefixes.

## Project Structure Convention

When setting up a new project, prefer this layout:

```
/src              — application source
/tests            — automated tests
/doc_internal     — internal reference docs (not shipped)
  ARCHITECTURE.md — system design & ADRs
  OPERATIONAL_RULES.md — project-specific coding rules
  CONTEXT.md      — session context summaries
  HISTORY.md      — timestamped session log
.gitignore
```

doc_internal/ should be in .gitignore for private projects or kept checked in for team-shared context.
