# Agent Safety Rules

Non-negotiable safety constraints for all sessions.

## Confirmation Required Before

- Any destructive command: rm -rf, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, git reset --hard, git push --force.
- Any deployment or publish action.
- Any command that modifies production data.
- Any command with side effects outside the working directory.

## Secrets & Credentials

- Never hard-code API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings in source.
- Strip secrets from all output before displaying.
- Never commit .env files or credential files.
- If a secret is found in code, flag it immediately.

## Password Storage

- Never store plain passwords in the database.
- Always hash passwords before storing using bcrypt, argon2, or equivalent.
- Consider passwordless auth (magic links, OAuth, passkeys) to avoid password storage entirely.

## Input Validation

- Validate and sanitize all external inputs at system boundaries.
- Never trust user input for SQL, shell commands, or file paths without sanitization.
- Apply principle of least privilege for service accounts and keys.

## Dependencies

- Keep dependencies updated.
- Review new dependencies before adding (license, maintenance status, security advisories).
- Prefer well-maintained libraries with active communities.
